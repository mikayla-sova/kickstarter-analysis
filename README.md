# Kickstarting with Excel
---
## Overview and Purpose of Project
- The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the Kickstarter data in order to track trends for how the kickstarters performed in reference to their goals and in reference to their launch dates. Specifically, this analysis helps show the trends using visualizations in the form of line graphs so that the data can be more clearly absorbed.

## Analysis and Challenges

- In this Challenge, I followed the instructions to get the information I would need to create my visual aids. I broke down the process of finding the specific information for each data trend variable by selecting certain pieces of data in comparison to the whole of the data so that I could look at data relevant to Louise’s preferences. After following the steps for creating the tables I needed and then the graphs that went along with those tables, I saved the graphs as an image and put them in my resources folder.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- When I found myself stuck, the Hints helped to give me a direction on where I might need some further assistance. In addition, using Google to try and supplement my understanding of Excel formulas was helpful. In creating the first Pivot Table graph, I ran into a problem where I was not quite sure how to get the first column to represent months instead of years. However, after receiving context clues from the assignment and referring to the previous examples we covered in class, it became more intuitive. The second deliverable was less familiar of a process, but watching the assigned video helped with my understanding. Copy and paste also helped to break down the task to be more manageable instead of tedious. In addition, asking a classmate for help also proved to be fruitful! In the “Outcomes Based on Goal” table, I began to worry when I would enter a formula into the table and all of the outcomes for canceled plays were 0. This worried me, but after double checking my work by filtering the raw data worksheet, I realized that this was not an error.

## Results

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- The first conclusion I can draw about the “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date” data is that May, June, and July saw the highest number of successful outcomes for Theater kickstarters, with numbers in the 80s for July and the 100s for June and May. The second conclusion I can draw is that May, June, July, August, and October saw, also, the highest number of failed outcomes for Theater kickstarters with numbers in the late 40s and 50s.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- I can conclude from the “Outcomes Based on Goals” data that there were 0 canceled kickstarters in the play subcategory across all the goal options. In addition, I can also say that while the goal of 1000 to 4999 had the most number of successes, the most successful goal percentage-wise was the less than 1000 goal category. Finally, after the goal shifts past 5000, the outcomes vary widely. Goals less than 5000 have a trend towards less success the higher the goal amount, and more success the lower the goal amount.

What are some limitations of this dataset?

- Some limitations of this dataset include the obvious in that most of these points have to do with quantitative data rather than qualitative. We can look at the graphs and tendencies of various variables and the outcomes of the success of a kickstarter. However, we cannot determine exactly the “why” on these conclusions. For example, we know that theater kickstarters for this dataset are most successful when they launch in May, but I cannot determine why that is just from looking at the data set. Perhaps paired with another data set detailing backer information and preferences would help give insights to this kind of “why” question one might ask about the dataset.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

- Other possible tables and graphs we could create could focus on outcomes based on country, whether or not they were “staff picks” or in the “spotlight”, as well as perhaps looking at the average donations and seeing the trends in which kickstarters have the highest average donations.
